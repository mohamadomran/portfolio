# How to Change the Color of SVGs.

If you're working on a project that requires the use of SVG icons, you might have run into the issue of the icons not inheriting the color of the parent component. This can be a problem if you need to use the same icon in multiple places with different colors. However, there is a simple solution.

The SVG `<path>` element has a `fill` property that defines the color of the line drawn. By default, this property is set to a specific color code like `#FFFFFF`, which means the stroke will be this color no matter what.

To make your SVG files inherit the color of the parent component, you should change the value of `fill` to `currentColor`. This means that the SVG will take the value of the color property from its parent.

By using this method, you can easily change the color of your SVG icons by simply changing the color of the parent component. This is a practical and efficient solution that can save you time and effort in your projects.
